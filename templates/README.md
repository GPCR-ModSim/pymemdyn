**NOTE ON GROMACS METHODS**
To integrate  the equations of  motion we have selected  the leap-frog
integrator with  a 2 femtosecond timestep.   Longe-range electrostatic
interactions  in periodic  boundary  conditions are  treated with  the
particle mesh  Ewald method.  We  use a Nose-Hoover thermostat  with a
tau_t of 0.5 picoseconds and  a Parinello-Rahman barostat with a tau_p
of 2.0.   The pressure  coupling is  semiisotropic, meaning  that it's
isotropic in the x and y  directions but different in the z direction.
Since  we are  using  pressure coupling  we are  working  with an  NPT
ensemble. This  is done both in  the all-atom restrained steps  and in
the alpha-carbon atom restrained part.   All of these details are more
explicitly stated in the Rodriguez et al. [1] publication.


**TIPS**  

NOTE: these tips work for GROMACS version 2021. For later versions, 
adjustments may be required, but the principle remains the same.

- If you want to configure a .tpr input file for a **production** run, you
can use the template 'prod.mdp' file by introducing the number of 
steps (nsteps) and/or the time between steps (dt), you want to run.  

After that, you just have to type:  
    gmx grompp -f prod.mdp -c confout.gro -p prod.top -n index.ndx -o topol_prod.tpr

    gmx mdrun -s topol_prod.tpr -o traj.trr -e ener.edr -c confout.gro -g prod.log -x traj_prod.xtc

- If you did not execute the **full_relax** protocol to relaxate your system you can run the following commands. If you wish to adjust the relaxation protocol, you can modify the template 'eqCA.mdp' (with C-alpha position restraints) or 'dres.mdp' (with Venkatakrishnan pairs distance restraints). It is highly recommended to first do a (modified) full_relax protocol prior to a **production** run.

With C-alpha position restraints:
    gmx grompp -f eqCA.mdp -c logs/confout200.gro -r logs/confout200.gro -p processed.top -n index.ndx -o topol_relax.tpr -maxwarn 1
With BW distance restraints:
    gmx grompp -f dres.mdp -c logs/confout200.gro -p processed.top -n index.ndx -o topol_relax.tpr -maxwarn 1

    gmx mdrun -s topol_relax.tpr -o traj.trr -e ener.edr -c logs/confout200.gro -g relax.log -x traj_relax.xtc

- If  you  want  to  create  a  PDB file  of  your  system  after  the
equilibration, with the receptor centered in the box, type:  

    echo 1 0 | gmx trjconv -pbc mol -center -ur compact -f confout.gro -o confout.pdb

- If you want to create an xmgrace graph of the root mean square
  deviation for c-alpha atoms in the 5.0 ns of simulation you can use:  

    echo 3 3 | gmx rms -f traj_EQ.xtc -s topol.tpr -o rmsd-calpha-vs-start.xvg

- You may want to get a pdb file of your last frame. You can first
check the total time of your trajectory and then use this time to
request the last frame with:

    gmx check -f traj_pymol.xtc
    echo 1 | gmx trjconv -b 5000 -e 5000 -f traj_pymol.xtc -o last51.pdb
