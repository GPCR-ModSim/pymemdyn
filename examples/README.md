Overview of examples:

basic_gpcra
--------------

aa2br_human
Structure generated by PyModSim (AlphaFold + refinement)

Input includes:
	- protein chain (GPCR class A)

Class A GPCRs can be used with BW restraints, which have are 
superior to CA restraints.


basic_other
--------------

sc6a2_human
Structure generated by PyModSim (AlphaFold + refinement)

Input includes:
	- protein chain

Any other membrane proteins than Class A GPCRs can be used 
in PyMemDyn, although CA restraints must be used.


ligand_allosteric:
--------------

cb1_human (6kqi)
Structure from X-ray.

Input includes:
	- protein chain
	- ligand
	- allosteric


oligomer_cofactors:
--------------

aa1r (2x), aa2ar (2x), g protein (2x) complex
Structure from prepared system.
Input includes:
	- 10x protein chain
	- waters
	- ions
